    <p>
        A Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC), is a technique for constructing
        a message authentication code from a block cipher.

<h2 class="text-h2-lightblue">About the experiment</h2>
    <p>
        In the experiment we provide a "dummy" block cipher (that is just a function and has none of the properties of a real block cipher)  and  ask
        you to use it to compute the CBC_MAC tag of an arbitrary message
